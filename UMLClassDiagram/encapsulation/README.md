## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data and methods into a single unit (a class) and controlling access to that unit. It allows the developer to hide the implementation details of an object from the outside world and only expose the necessary information through a public interface.  

Encapsulation in Java is achieved through the use of access modifiers (public, private, protected) and getter and setter methods. The access modifiers determine the level of access that the class members have, and the getter and setter methods are used to read and modify the values of private class members.
