A UML (Unified Modeling Language) Use Case Diagram is a graphical representation of the functional requirements of a system or software application. It provides a visual overview of the different actors, or users, of the system and the various use cases, or interactions, that they have with the system.  

Use case diagrams typically include the following elements:

* Actors: These are the different users or entities that interact with the system.

* Use cases: These are the different tasks or functions that the system must perform to satisfy the needs of the actors.

* Relationships: These are the associations between the actors and the use cases.

* System boundaries: These define the limits of the system and identify what is included and what is excluded from the system.

* Optional elements: Other elements such as include, extend, and generalization relationships can also be included to provide more detail and complexity to the diagram.

Overall, a use case diagram is a useful tool for visualizing and communicating the requirements and functionality of a system or software application.
