## Abstraction

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows developers to create complex systems by focusing on the essential features and ignoring the details that are not necessary for the task at hand. Abstraction allows developers to create models of complex systems that are easier to understand and modify, leading to more maintainable and efficient code.  

Abstraction is achieved in OOP by creating abstract classes and interfaces that define the behavior of an object without specifying the implementation details. These abstract classes and interfaces provide a blueprint for concrete classes that implement them. The concrete classes are responsible for providing the specific implementation details of the abstract classes and interfaces.
