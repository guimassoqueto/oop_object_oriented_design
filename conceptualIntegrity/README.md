## Conceptual Integrity

Conceptual integrity is a software design principle that emphasizes the importance of consistency and coherence in the architecture and implementation of a system. It refers to the degree to which the design of a software system reflects a unified and coherent vision, with all components working together in a cohesive and consistent way.

Conceptual integrity is important because it helps to ensure that a system is easy to understand, modify, and maintain. A system with high conceptual integrity is generally more reliable, easier to debug, and less prone to errors and bugs. It also helps to ensure that the system meets the requirements and expectations of its users, and that it is scalable and adaptable to changing needs.

To achieve conceptual integrity, developers need to establish a clear and consistent vision for the system, define and follow design guidelines and standards, and ensure that all components of the system work together in a cohesive and integrated way. This requires careful planning, communication, and collaboration among all stakeholders involved in the development process.
