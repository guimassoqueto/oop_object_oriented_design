## Coupling and Cohesion

Coupling and cohesion are two important concepts in object-oriented programming that refer to the degree of interdependence between different components of a software system.

Coupling refers to the degree to which different modules or classes in a system rely on each other. In general, lower coupling is desirable, as it makes the system more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain. High coupling can result in code that is difficult to modify, test, or reuse, as changes to one module can have a ripple effect throughout the system.

Cohesion, on the other hand, refers to the degree to which the elements within a module or class are related to each other and serve a single, well-defined purpose. High cohesion is generally desirable, as it promotes encapsulation, readability, and maintainability. Low cohesion can result in classes that are overly complex, difficult to understand, and prone to errors.

In summary, coupling and cohesion are two important design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create software systems that are modular, flexible, and easy to maintain.
